Hi All,<br>
Here's the upcoming schedule:<br>
Students, if you're planning to come in, please be in your seats with your laptops open at the start time.  That way we can begin on time and be courteous to  all the people who volunteered their time to prepare a presentation (don't make them wait and have to re-explain things over to you because you're late).
<br>
Presenters, if you need the class to download or install something first, please let us know at least a day in advance to save time.
<br>
